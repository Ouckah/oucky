# Oucky Discord Bot

Oucky, the Discord bot for a community of computer science students, was not just built by one person but by members of the community itself. The idea of creating a bot that would enhance the experience of the community's Discord server was suggested by Alex, also known as Pengu, who is also a member of the community.

This idea was shared with the community, and it quickly gained traction. Many members were excited about the idea of having a bot that could highlight code snippets, play tic-tac-toe, and provide random jokes and reminders. However, Ouckah knew that they alone could not build the bot, so they put out a call for volunteers who could help with coding, testing, and debugging the bot.

The community response was overwhelming. Many members stepped forward, offering their skills and time to help build Oucky. Teams were formed to work on specific features, and regular meetings were held to discuss progress and solve problems. The process of building the bot not only brought together members of the community who had not interacted before, but it also fostered a sense of camaraderie and collaboration that had not been seen before.

As the bot took shape, it became clear that Oucky was not just a tool for enhancing the Discord server experience, but also a symbol of the community's unity and creativity. Members who had worked on the bot felt a sense of ownership and pride in what they had achieved. The bot was officially launched with great fanfare, and it quickly became a beloved addition to the Discord server.

## What We Learned
To build Oucky, the team used a range of skills including Discord.js, Node.js, and Javascript API usage. They also relied heavily on collaborative skills using Github, working together to share code, track issues and merge changes to the project. The team was made up of developers from all over the world, with different levels of expertise and backgrounds, but they all shared a passion for computer science and a desire to create something useful for the Ouckah community.
