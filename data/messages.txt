[04/08/2023 5:44 PM] lindo#3918
it looks hard


[04/08/2023 5:44 PM] Luke#2007
just do int(intput()) in the print itself


[04/08/2023 5:44 PM] Luke#2007
dont def your own input


[04/08/2023 5:44 PM] Bloodybeast#5002
alright


[04/08/2023 5:44 PM] lindo#3918
wait


[04/08/2023 5:44 PM] lindo#3918
is that comp science


[04/08/2023 5:44 PM] Luke#2007
honestly comp sci is mostly learning how to communicate

completely remove line 1


[04/08/2023 5:46 PM] lindo#3918

if you want a more readable version:
```py
response = input("Enter a number: ") # Takes in input from the user

response_number = int(response) # Converts the number to an integer

result = fizz_buzz(response_number) # Feeds the number into the "fizz_buzz" function

print(result) # prints the result to the console
```

[04/09/2023 10:35 AM] pengu#0765
Nothing crazy, making a chatgpt clone with the openai api just so I can try out gpt 4 without paying 20$ a month😭 and its helping me keep my typescript knowledge from going away


[04/09/2023 10:36 AM] pengu#0765
Typescript is such a nice language


[04/09/2023 10:38 AM] ouckah#1436
CHAT GPT CLONE SHEEESHH


[04/09/2023 10:38 AM] ouckah#1436
i drfinutrly gotta learn typescript it’s like the one thing holding me back from advancing in front end


[04/09/2023 11:17 AM] pengu#0765
Man definitely worth it, especially if youre already comfortable with JS is beautiful!


[04/09/2023 11:26 AM] ouckah#1436
it just adds typing to JS right? or does it add more


[04/09/2023 11:40 AM] pengu#0765
Theres more!


[04/09/2023 11:41 AM] pengu#0765
Interfaces, tuples, generics (goes with typing), type aliases and a couple more things I’m probably forgetting

[04/11/2023 6:11 PM] Luke#2007
What’s the problem


[04/11/2023 6:11 PM] ouckah#1436
1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
Medium
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).


[04/11/2023 6:14 PM] Luke#2007
Oh fun what language

i had a 🤓 moment in class bro


[04/13/2023 12:11 PM] ouckah#1436
so we learned about hashmaps in DSA and we previously used the nested for loop solution for Two Sum on LC before learning that so


[04/13/2023 12:11 PM] ouckah#1436
she asked the class how can we use a hashmap for a better solution


[04/13/2023 12:12 PM] ouckah#1436
and one kid said to use the indexes of numbers as keys and the nums in the given list as values


[04/13/2023 12:12 PM] Enqtz#2654
?


[04/13/2023 12:12 PM] ouckah#1436
and I said “akchually 🤓☝️i think you would use the nums as the keys and the indexes as the values”

@ouckah You could do 
```js
async function generateInsult() {
  // code here
}
```
outside the execute, that should work, maybe

@pengu look how beautiful this is ```markdown
Oucky, the Discord bot for a community of computer science students, was not just built by one person but by members of the community itself. The idea of creating a bot that would enhance the experience of the community's Discord server was suggested by TikToker Ouckah, who is also a member of the community.

Ouckah shared their idea with the community, and it quickly gained traction. Many members were excited about the idea of having a bot that could highlight code snippets, play tic-tac-toe, and provide random jokes and reminders. However, Ouckah knew that they alone could not build the bot, so they put out a call for volunteers who could help with coding, testing, and debugging the bot.

The community response was overwhelming. Many members stepped forward, offering their skills and time to help build Oucky. Teams were formed to work on specific features, and regular meetings were held to discuss progress and solve problems. The process of building the bot not only brought together members of the community who had not interacted before, but it also fostered a sense of camaraderie and collaboration that had not been seen before.

As the bot took shape, it became clear that Oucky was not just a tool for enhancing the Discord server experience, but also a symbol of the community's unity and creativity. Members who had worked on the bot felt a sense of ownership and pride in what they had achieved. The bot was officially launched with great fanfare, and it quickly became a beloved addition to the Discord server.

ill look up what that is

I think I have a fix for the emoji count but I can't test PR posted


[04/16/2023 5:46 PM] ouckah#1436
hmmm i wish there was a way for you guys to test without needing my token


[04/16/2023 5:46 PM] ouckah#1436
i might just send people who are interested in working on it the config file what do you think


[04/16/2023 5:47 PM] ouckah#1436
it would raise the risk of yk token stealing but i trust you guys


[04/16/2023 5:47 PM] ouckah#1436
and it’s just like a community project yk what kinda person would just ruin a discord bot for no reason


[04/16/2023 5:48 PM] AurynAtreyu#1731
IDk how running two instances of the same bot would pan out is my only thought


[04/16/2023 5:48 PM] ouckah#1436
hmmm


[04/16/2023 5:48 PM] ouckah#1436
you know any other ways people have collaboratively worked on discord bots?


[04/16/2023 5:48 PM] ouckah#1436
cause coding without testing sounds horrendous


[04/16/2023 5:49 PM] AurynAtreyu#1731
fr


[04/16/2023 5:50 PM] ouckah#1436
i looked it up, there’s something called a “developer team” discord offers, might look into that


[04/16/2023 5:51 PM] AurynAtreyu#1731
What I could do is use my bot token and test that way on a personal server, I didn’t think of that but it’s an easy way for me to test


[04/16/2023 5:53 PM] ouckah#1436
i wassss thinking that, and just have people pull the commands into their own personal bot


[04/16/2023 5:53 PM] AurynAtreyu#1731
I already have a bot hooked up so for me easy peasy


[04/16/2023 5:53 PM] ouckah#1436
it just generates the hassle of everyone making their own application and going through the whole process of making a bot


[04/16/2023 5:53 PM] ouckah#1436

how do I get more motivated for sides instead of leet


[04/17/2023 11:43 AM] ouckah#1436
SHEEESHHHH BRO


[04/17/2023 11:43 AM] ouckah#1436
i respect the grind but yeah finding a balance is important


[04/17/2023 11:43 AM] ouckah#1436
i’d say the best way is to do a “passion project” or something on you’re passionate about


[04/17/2023 11:44 AM] ouckah#1436
i don’t know much about you but i know you know JavaScript right and you played Valorant? Maybe using a Valorant / RIOT API to track like your kills and rank in a website and make the UI look good


[04/17/2023 11:45 AM] ouckah#1436
and i’d say start with small stuff and work your way to bigger side projects, starting with a GIANT side project might be too overwhelming


[04/17/2023 11:48 AM] En#0001
mmmmm I like that idea


[04/17/2023 11:48 AM] En#0001
yeah Im gonna do that and stop leetcoding for a little then get an actual balance going


[04/17/2023 11:48 AM] En#0001
bc i get consumed


[04/17/2023 11:50 AM] ouckah#1436
and you don’t have to stop leeting while you do the project! just limit yourself to like 1-3 problems a day haha


[04/17/2023 11:51 AM] ouckah#1436
maybe even with the extra time plan out your leetcode problems, like one week work on graphs and another work on dp


[04/17/2023 11:51 AM] En#0001
mm yea i need to do a lot more dp problems


[04/17/2023 11:52 AM] En#0001

bc if you look at it prjnting a spiral array is really just printing the surrounding elements but putting it in a while loop.

Sup, just got some from school


[04/27/2023 9:56 AM] Enqtz#2654
I didn't code in like a week lol (except for html and css stuff)


[04/27/2023 9:56 AM] Enqtz#2654
I feel like that's probably not the grammatically correct way to say this


[04/27/2023 9:57 AM] ouckah#1436
i think it’s the cool way to say it


[04/27/2023 9:58 AM] ouckah#1436
that’s all good we all deserve breaks


[04/27/2023 9:58 AM] ouckah#1436
lets start the grind back up soon 😈


[04/27/2023 9:58 AM] Enqtz#2654
Let's gooo


[04/27/2023 9:59 AM] Enqtz#2654
I kind of gave up on Python


[04/27/2023 9:59 AM] Enqtz#2654
It's really not for me. Not because it's hard, in fact, it's the easiest thing I've ever learned


[04/27/2023 10:00 AM] Enqtz#2654
The syntax is very ugly and I don't like functional programming, which is the main paradigm for Python iirc


[04/27/2023 10:01 AM] Enqtz#2654
Java, TS and Rust are things I'll be going with


[04/27/2023 10:01 AM] ouckah#1436
gotcha gotcha i mean it’s good you know what you like 👍


[04/27/2023 10:02 AM] ouckah#1436
i love the silly things and syntax is python haha


[04/27/2023 10:06 AM] Enqtz#2654
Yeah Python has pretty much everything you'll ever need in-built, and a lot of people say that syntax is good too

I feel lazy after showers, so I force my body awake.


[05/07/2023 9:40 AM] Wound#0001
